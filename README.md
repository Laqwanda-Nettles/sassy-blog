## Day 1: SCSS Basics

### Objective

Design and develop a splash page for a blog site using HTML and SCSS. Focus on applying SCSS features like variables and nesting, and use BEM methodology for class naming.

### Reflection

I created a splash page for a fake travel blog using HTML & SCSS. This splash page contains a navbar, footer, cards, and hero image with a call to action section. This project involved defining SCSS variables, implementing BEM naming conventions, utilizing SCSS nesting, compiling SCSS to CSS, and designing the splash page to be visual appealing and responsive.

## Day 2: SCSS Modularization

### Objective

Develop a dashboard page for the sassy-blog project, applying SCSS modularization techniques. Focus on creating a functional, well-styled dashboard that complements the existing splash page.

### Reflection

The main focus was partials and imports.Partial SCSS files allow you to break down stylesheets into smaller, more manageable chunks, each focusing on specific aspects of styling. It also creates reuseable styles that can be imported into multiple files. Overall, SCSS partials and imports are valuable tools for structuring and organizing stylesheets in web development projects.

## Day 3: Mixins

### Objective

Enhance the sassy-blog dashboard by creating and using specific Sass Mixins. This assignment focuses on practical applications of Mixins to improve style reuse and consistency.

### Reflection

Mixins similar to using functions can take parameters allowing customized styles based on specific requirements. Mixins are beneficial because they can help reduce the amount of code, easier to maintain, and provide resuable cohesive designs.

## Day 4: 7-1 Sass Architecture

### Objective

Reorganize the Sass files of your sassy-blog project following the 7-1 Sass Architecture pattern. Enhance the project's styles by taking advantage of this organized structure.

### Reflection

The SCSS 7-1 architecture is like a personalized-style library. It organizes your stylesheets into different folders for things like basic styles - resets & typography, components, and layout. This makes it easier to manage your styles, reuse them, and keep your project organized and efficient.
